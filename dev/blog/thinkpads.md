# older (t4x0 and x2x0) thinkpads are amazing

they:
* have thousands of extra parts waiting for you to buy them on almost every website
* have a lot of upgradability
* are very functional, - still to this day - especially if you run gnu/linux or bsd on them
* usually are cheap
* can also be used as a server
* have superb linux support
* have a huge list of connectors, including possibilities for a egpu sometimes
* are practical to use
* are lightweight (some)
* have superb keyboards
* sometimes even have libre-/coreboot support
* are the true art of computing

seriously, i love thinkpads
