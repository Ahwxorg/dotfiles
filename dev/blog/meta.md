# Facebook isn't Meta, here's why:

So they basically try to tell everyone that they own the metaverse by nameing themself "Meta".

Let's look at what the Metaverse is exactly:

"In futurism and science fiction, the metaverse is a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal and immersive virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets. In colloquial use, a metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection."

Since Facebook or "Meta" doesn't own the entire internet and i.e. Discord isn't from Facebook. That's why Facebook is not Meta.
