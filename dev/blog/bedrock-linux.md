# bedrock linux
> bedrock linux is a meta distribution which allows the user to install other distros into it, you also install it by installing i.e. void/gentoo/arch and hijack that install by the script they provide.

## pros:
* ease of use once you understand it
* you get a shit ton of packages
* it doesn't use a lot of resoures to be on your system (almost no/within margin of error battery life loss, 20mb ram extra at most)
* easily switch init systems (althought i have not tried that yet)
* of course, it's linux so that's already a huge pro

## cons:
* might be a little overwhelming
* strata (distros) are quite picky with packages, for example if you already have void's base-devel packages, you need to install them on arch anyways, since they don't see packages from eachother, which leads to con 2:
* more storage space required (i currently use about 36GiB which includes about 16GiB of fonts)
* some things just don't work well together, check their website

## overall thoughts:

i like it very much
* ease of use is great
* packages from ubuntu might be a lot more stable (or they don't even exist for other distros) than from void, gentoo or arch and thus might be usefull
* it's cool :]

so, it's very likely for me to use it again in the future, but for example on top of gentoo- instead of void gnu/linux.
